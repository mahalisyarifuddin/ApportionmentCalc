## 2024-05-22 - Accessibility & UX
**Learning:** This project is a single-file HTML application. Any UX improvements need to be self-contained within `ApportionmentCalc.html`.
**Action:** Always check `ApportionmentCalc.html` for styles and scripts.

## 2024-05-22 - Modal Accessibility
**Learning:** Implementing custom modals requires manual focus management and keyboard support (Escape key) to be accessible. This can be done cleanly with event listeners and `activeElement` tracking.
**Action:** When creating or modifying modals, always add focus save/restore and Escape key handlers.
